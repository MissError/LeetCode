# 11. Container With Most Water



Given *n* non-negative integers *$a_1$* , $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ , where each represents a point at coordinate $(i, a_i)$. *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at $(i, a_i)$ and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```



**code：**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length-1;
        int maxarea = 0;
        while(left < right){
            maxarea = Math.max(maxarea,Math.min(height[left],height[right])*(right-left));
            if(height[left] < height[right]){
                left++;
            }
            else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
}
```
